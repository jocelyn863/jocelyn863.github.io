<h1>Tell me more about you</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Jocelyn and I love to write and I love to paint it is like all passion for me. I sometimes don't have patience in things that I really want or basically in general. I also just published a rap but I am thinking on doing another rap but in spanish but this time I want to do it in the studio. YOU KNOWWW YOU KNOWWWW!!! More information about me....because why not. I have a dog her name is Candy, she is really friendly but sometimes can be bipolar. I have also made memes of her because she does many funny stuff and I mean why not have fun with my dog.</p>

<p>Tell me more about yourself!!</p>
